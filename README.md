# Backbone Memory Store (BETA)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yxa/backbone.memory.png)](https://travis-ci.org/yxa/backbone.memory)



Quite simply a memory storage adapter for Backbone. It's a drop-in replacement for Backbone.Sync() to handle saving to memory.

## Usage

Include backbone.memory after having included Backbone.js:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="backbone.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="backbone.memory.js"></script>
```

## Contributing

You'll need node / phantomjs and to `npm install` before being able to run the tests.

1. Fork;
2. Write code;
3. Write tests (or vice et versa);
4. `npm test` or `open index.html`;
6. Create a pull request.

Have fun!
